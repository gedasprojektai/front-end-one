Values: 

- Focus
We focus on only a few things at once. We do not take multiple taks. We work all together, we discuss all together and we build a perfect product. 

- Creativity
We are testing new things, we are not afraid of to take risks and to fail and then try again. We are looking for the best solution.

- Resourcefulness 
For the achievement of our goals, as well as maximum efficiency of workflow we're able to utilize a variety of tools and gather information from various sources.

- Adaptability
We are able (if necessary) to reajust the course of work process responding to changing situation while keeping the goal of work unchanged.


Work approach principles:

- Value-based prioritization
We emphasize the focus of Scrum to deliver maximum business value. The most important and valuable project parts go first. 

- Flexibility in working
We use different ways to achieve the goal. Sometimes we work and discuss online and sometimes we meet to discuss the idea faster.

- Utilization of third-party applications and resources
In order to achieve best results and optimize the work process as much as possible, we employ various applications for communication, such as Discord, and several open-source tools, such as automatic online compiler bot.

- Prudence in making decisions
We don't limit ourselves with the "only possible" solution. For each stage of the project besides the main we also forsee backup solution.
