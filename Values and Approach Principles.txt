Values: 

- Focus
We focus on only a few things at once. We do not take multiple taks. We work all together, we discuss all together and we build a perfect product. 

- Creativity
We are testing new things, we are not afraid of to take risks and to fail and then try again. We are looking for the best solution.


Work approach principles:

- Value-based prioritization
We emphasize the focus of Scrum to deliver maximum business value. The most important and valuable project parts go first. 

- Flexibility in working
We use different ways to achieve the goal. Sometimes we work and discuss online and sometimes we meet to discuss the idea faster.
